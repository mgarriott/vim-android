INTRODUCTION                                     *android*

This plugin provides several convenience commands to make development for
android easier with VIM.

ANDROID-COMMANDS                                 *android-commands*

The following is a list of Ex commands that wrap the functionality of the
"android" executable found in the android platform-tools.

                                                 *Alisttargets*

Agoto                     Tag-like navigation, but this command also allows
                          you to easily navigate to resources from within the
                          source code. Recommended mapping: <C-]>.
